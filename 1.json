MPLS LSPs using the link to fail and potentially attempt rerouting (if FRR or secondary paths configured).\nEach subsequent up event triggers the reverse: IGP adjacency forms, new updates flood, SPF runs again, LDP/RSVP/BGP attempt to re-establish, LSPs may revert.\nFlapping is often worse than a hard down because it causes continuous network instability: constant recalculations consume router CPU, topology churn prevents convergence, traffic may blackhole briefly during transitions, and protocols may enter dampening states (e.g., BGP flap dampening) further delaying restoration.

	    "expected_output": "Explains that receiving a BGP Notification means the *remote* peer (203.0.113.5, AS 65200) detected an error in an UPDATE message sent *by the local router*. The specific error 'Update Message Error / Invalid Next Hop Attribute' (Code 3, Subcode 8) means the local router sent a BGP update containing a next-hop IP address that the remote router considers invalid according to BGP rules (e.g., for eBGP, the next-hop must typically be the IP address of the sending router on the peering subnet, unless `next-hop-self` or specific policies are used). This implies the configuration fault likely lies on the *local* router, specifically in its route policies or BGP export configuration that determines the next-hop attribute for advertised routes."

Minimal traffic loss expected for protected LSPs.\n3. OSPF adjacency over Port 1/1/3 will drop. Router_A will flood updated LSAs removing the link. Routers in the area will recalculate SPF. Traffic previously routed via the direct A-C link based on IGP cost will now use the higher-cost path via Router_B.\n4. LDP/RSVP adjacencies over the link will drop.\n5. BGP session(s) directly over the link (if any) will drop. BGP sessions relying on the IGP path via C might also reconverge if next-hops change, potentially causing brief BGP instability. Traffic will shift to alternate BGP paths.\n6. Transit LSPs not using the link directly but relying on the IGP path over A-C might also trigger make-before-break or standard rerouting onto the new shortest path via B.\n7. Overall impact: Brief reconvergence event. Protected traffic (MPLS FRR) sees minimal impact. Unprotected traffic follows IGP/BGP reconvergence, potentially seeing slightly longer outage/reroute time. Network stabilizes using path via Router_B. Latency might increase due to potentially longer/higher-cost path."
